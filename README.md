# FYE
The Official Application for The First Year Experience Program at The American University in Cairo (2015)

üè´üìì The application is implemented in **iOS** using **Swift & Objective-C** and in **Android** using **Java** with **MySQL** databases as a backend, interfaced to using **PHP scripts**. It provides freshmen with information regarding AUC (places that offer student discount, on-campus services and food outlets, etc.) and the FYE program (schedules, maps, and inforgraphics) as well as useful services such as group chat rooms, and an in-board video player for FYE's Youtube channel.
It used to be available on the App Store and Play Store and has been downloaded and used by 3,000+ people, but is now discontinued.

### I had planned to further expand the application in the following ways:
* To create my own map implementation for both Android and iOS.
* To integrate the food outlet menus and allow students to order from the application.
* To implement a wallet system where students can store change that any outlet has not given them back and spend it later.
* To find a way to make a profit out of the app, either by charging food outlets, or looking for monthly sponsors.

## Third Party APIs Used:
### Android:
* Picasso - for handling images
* PhotoView - for zooming in on images
* Youtube API - for getting videos in a channel and displaying them
* Firebase - for authentication, notifications, and messaging
### iOS:
* Firebase - same as android
* Youtube API - same as android
* ImageScrollView - for zooming in on images
